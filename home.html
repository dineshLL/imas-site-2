                    <h2>Goal Of the System</h2>
                    <p>
                        With the advancement in technology the benefit that a person
                        gets from day to day life has been exponentially increased. Out
                        of all the possible products which has been developed, the main
                        field which has gone beyond a certain extent is the information
                        technology field. Out of all the products available there is some
                        way in which the product has been managed to a certain level
                        by making use of some mechanism available in the IT area. The
                        development of products related to this area, requires a proper
                        plan. This is where the architectures of applications come into
                        play. That is the proper planning of technology based on the
                        consumerâ€™s need. However, in terms of building such systems
                        which would be able to complete complex tasks with the least
                        number of defects is extremely difficult.
                        Cloud computing is the most promising fields of
                        technology available today. This basically covers the concept
                        of internet based computing. The area of computer technology
                        has been enhanced to make use of networks where the
                        capability of one node can be utilized in other nodes. This
                        means it is possible to have multiple computers connected to
                        provide the necessary processing to complete a particular tasks.
                        Thus it opens many areas which has not been thought of at the
                        earlier introduction of the internet. But along with the
                        advantages there come some disadvantages basically the
                        balancing of the load of a server. There are many architectures
                        on which a server level application can be built upon. The
                        current mainstream ones are built upon the Service oriented
                        architecture. The SOA is the main architecture that is being
                        used to achieve interoperability between systems. The main
                        purpose is to reduce the amount of dependent code that will be
                        present in the system. This is achieved by following a standard
                        mechanism for the data transfer. This is mainly focused on data
                        piping. There are many other architectures which have been
                        built upon this architecture as the base. One such example is the
                        micro service architecture. There are many advantages that
                        are present while making use of this architecture while there are
                        also many disadvantages.
                        As this architecture is built with the principle of
                        scalability as the main aspect, it is highly adaptable. But
                        since it is adaptable it becomes difficult to keep track of the
                        services individually. Out system provides a solution for such
                        problems. The current systems that are deployed such as the
                        Amazon Web Services make use of the elastic balancing
                        mechanism which makes use of virtualization for the purpose
                        of having multiple instances of different applications to be
                        deployed within a single server.This introduces the
                        possibility of having internal traffic within the servers thus
                        putting more load to the internal systems, this includes the
                        issues which will need to be faced when thus it becomes a
                        necessity to introduce a load balancing mechanism to handle
                        the internal load to the split up virtual machines. The elastic
                        load balancing used by AWS makes use of different mechanism
                        for the sole purpose for scaling. The existing system makes
                        use of variations of the heartbeat mechanism for the purpose of
                        identifying live and dead services in the network, the algorithm
                        currently being used for this purpose is known as SWIM.
                        To overcome such issues, the micro services architecture was
                        built by Martin Fowler. The basic idea was to have a
                        containerized system, i.e. multiple VMâ€™s running different
                        functionalities with the least amount of coupling possible.
                        Micro service architecture can be used to create an application
                        where the micro service instance level coupling is too low. So
                        that the application can be scaled as per to the requirements. But
                        in a normal micro service based application there can be number
                        of independent micro service instances allocated to do specific
                        task where the application managers could not be able to
                        identify each individual micro service instance which should be
                        scaled up or down. This is one of the main reasons where most
                        of the companies do not go for micro service based architectures
                        But with intelligent auto scaling the application itself will
                        identify the load patterns and resource consumption of each
                        running micro service and based on the collected data and the
                        past data the application will auto scale which will remove the
                        burden of management of the application from the respective
                        engineers.
                        Google has implemented a platform named
                        Kubernetes which is one of the key tools available for container
                        orchestration. It implements an auto scaling module but it
                        is based only on the cup consumption level of micro service
                        instances. The existing system will be able to manage the micro
                        services individually via rules, but this again would require
                        human intervention for the system to function with the least
                        downtime in production. Our main project is focused on
                        the development of a mechanism or tool which would be able
                        to bypass this limitation without giving any disadvantage to the
                        user.
                        The existing system will be able to manage a system which is
                        developed using the micro services, this would give an overall
                        visibility of how the system which is deployed, will function in
                        a live environment. The current drawback which has been
                        identified would be that the system would not be able to scale
                        if there are requests for which it would not be able to find the
                        pattern for. Therefore in the future it would be necessary for
                        implementing an architecture which would be able to bypass
                        these limitations without any constraints in place.
