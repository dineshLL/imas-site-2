                <p> 
                    This research mainly focuses on the development of applications which makes use of the microservices architecture. 
                    The research component of the project would be to find out whether it is possible scale the micro services.
                     The domain which it focuses on is cloud computing.With the growth of the internet infrastructure it has become necessary to introduce methods of auto scaling the systems based on requirements. There now exist systems which do not follow the monolith architecture, but rather distribute them into multiple modules / components that will perform a highly focused and completely decoupled task such as Unix Commands ex:- ls, While giving out a complete Business Scenario by combining each of these components together. This architecture is known as the micro service architecture. This architecture is on standard deployed onto a system known as the docker. By normal standards, a single microservice will be deployed as a single docker container but it is possible to run multiple microservices in a single container as well. The problem which we had identified with the existing system is that it does not allow the system to be horizontally scalable. That is if the load for a particular docker VM increases, another instance will need to be created on a distributed system to balance out the processing. The current system needs heavy human interaction to manage each of these docker containers to achieve the expected performance of the system , Our proposed system will be to implement a load balancer which would be able to automatically scale the containers while not requiring any human interaction at all and distribute the load among multiple running instances of the  containers based on the analysis performed from the data gathered using our system.

                                    With the introduction of the micro services architecture researchers came to the understanding that this is the most anticipated architecture for the applications which followed service orientation. But with the advantages it brought complexity to the management of the application.so researchers started to find ways to eliminate this disadvantages from the architecture because they have identified micro services architecture is worth finding solutions for its disadvantages than throwing away and use the monoliths again. so that, companies like Google also initiated projects to solve this matter, thus there are some open source products to manage micro service applications.

                                    Cloud computing architectures are inherently parallel, distributed and serve the needs of multiple clients in different scenarios. This distributed architecture deploys resources distributive to deliver services efficiently to users in different geographical channels. Clients in a distributed environment generate request randomly in any processor. So the major drawback of this randomness is associated with task assignment. The unequal task assignment to the processor creates imbalance i.e., some of the processors are overloaded and some of them are under loaded. The objective of load balancing is to transfer the load from overloaded process to under loaded process transparently. A research has been done on comparison of four popular load balancing algorithms of virtual machine in cloud computing, have discussed starting with dividing the types of algorithms as static and dynamic.

                                            The main requirement of this research is to create an intelligent micro service scalar which will learn when to scale up and down, what are the most important business scenarios which needs the priority without a user interaction.at the same time it is intended to create a graphical user interface where it would display the business scenarios and which micro services are aggregated to complete a specific scenario as there are the most crucial limitations that are there in the available products.

                                            The major focus of the intended system is to create an intelligent micro service scaling system which will do the required scaling without getting user inputs. Since existing system do not provide the functionality to do the scaling process without user interaction. This is a critical function for micro service eco system because most of the small companies do not go for micro services architecture as they do not compose the required skilled human resource to the management of the application.so if the application can grow and sink on its own without the interaction of humans, the company needs only to develop the application.

                                                After talking with the experts in the domain we have identified that, to develop and get the supposed power of a micro service application it need to have a well experienced software architects to architect the application.it needs to separate into modules in a well-defined manner because if one micro service do contain irrelevant code modules which needs to be in a separate micro service the decoupling of the application will be compromised and it would result in low performance. But the most dangerous thing is the developers or the architect cannot identity the enlargement of the service after deployment because they need a way to identify the business scenarios and what are the micro services that come together to solve the problem [8][9]. Unfortunately currently available container orchestration systems suffer from lacking this functionality. So from the proposed system we have planned to eliminate this problem by identifying the business scenarios using machine learning modules and show it to the administrators or the architects of the application where they can decide whether to keep the service as it is or do a refactoring and separate the logic into two or more new micro services.

                                                There are many facts that needs to be taken into consideration when there is a need to the scaling of a micro service application like CPU load, memory utilization, storage utilization, network utilization. These are the absolute measurements which are taken from the server itself but the absolute measurements can give wrong intentions. For examples  
                                        </p>
                                    </li>
                                    <li class="list-group-item wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="1000ms" data-wow-delay="400ms">
                                        <p>
                                                The component load can go up when we are deploying a new micro service and the memory utilization can go high because of a memory leak or a bad development.
                                                But the existing systems like kubernetes is taking only the CPU load of the application to scale the pod as they have named the micro service like that. This is again a place where we go beyond the existing implementations. We will consider about required absolute measurements and we will use measurements from the web gateway using an analytics server and validate the absolute measurements where the system will calculate a weight based measurement using the validated absolute measurements and the relative measurements which will be most appropriate to be used to take the decisions whether to scale up or scale down the application.    
                                        </p>
                                    </li>
                                    <li class="list-group-item wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="1000ms" data-wow-delay="400ms">
                                        <p>
                                                One of the main objective of the micro service architecture is to have high availability by using redundant instances of the same micro service. So for these applications there can be load patterns where for a particular season load will be very high and vice versa. When diving into the available applications we can see that they do the scaling in a static manner where they take a performance metric and do the scaling accordingly. But we have identified that this approach has a drawback. For an example we can take a load pattern where the load is increased at the morning and decreased after noon. We will take this as a regular pattern. How this pattern is handled by the currently available systems is by identifying the increment of the load when it happens and increase the instances to manage it handle it. this would not be a better solution because the requests that will be used to identify the load increment will not consume the redundant instance power.so we came up with a plan to analyze the load patterns and anticipate for the increments or the decrements of the loads, so that the application can do an anticipation scaling to match the requirement. Which is also not available in the current micro service scaling systems.

                                                In existing systems using load balancing, the execution time for each individual micro services are not considered. As time goes on the execution time might increase this might happen when the entries for the database increases or the number of concurrent users using increases. We will consider all of these factors while considering the scaling of the micro services.

                            Because of the operational complexity and the lacking of the required automation tools it has become very difficult to implement a micro service application so the smaller companies which do not possess the required skilled human resources, do not go for micro services even if they understand the importance of the architecture and the benefits. The main problem we are trying to solve is to give a more efficient approach in the management of a system that has been developed using the micro services architecture. The tools which are required for the management of a system developed using the micro services are not currently available in the market.
